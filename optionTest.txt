1. What is the following a description of: A built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component?

A. state
B. component init() function
C. propClass
D. Redux class

answer: A

2. What optimization does useMemo help with?

A. It helps to cache data fetched from Redux stores.
B. It helps to avoid expensive calculation on every render.
C. It helps cache data that was retrieved from a call to useEffect.

answer: B


3. What is the purpose of using fragments (<>...) in React?

A. Fragments are used to enhance the security of React applications by encapsulating components and preventing external access to their internal state.
B. Fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM, helping to keep the DOM tree clean and optimize performance.
C. Fragments serve as placeholders for future components, allowing developers to dynamically inject components based on state or props without altering the DOM structure.
D. Fragments provide a way to apply global CSS styles to a group of components without the need for a parent wrapper component.

answer: B

4. Which method is commonly used for conditional rendering in React?

A. Using `switch` statement directly within the JSX to select which component to render.
B. Employing a loop to iterate over components and render them only if they match a set of predefined conditions.
C. Using the ternary operator(`condition ? true:false`) within the JSX to render components or elements based on a condition.
D. Applying CSS classes to hide or show elements, thereby controlling their rendering on the page.

correct: C


5. What is the primary reason for using the useCallback hook in React?

A. To asynchronously fetch data and update the component state when the data is received, minimizing the number of renders and improving the user experience.
B. To memoize functions and prevent them from being recreated on every render, which can help in optimizing performance, especially with components  that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
C. To directly manipulate the DOM elements within functional components, enabling smoother transitions and animations without re-rendering the component.
D. To store state information in a global context, making it easily accessible across multiple components without having to prop drill.

correct: B

6. In React, what triggers a component to re-render?

A. Components re-render every time the user interacts with the application, regardless of whether the state or props relevant to that component have changed.
B. A re-render is triggered exclusively by changes in the global state of the application, such as context or Redux store updates, rather than changes in local state or props.
C. A component re-renders when its state or props change, as React needs to call the component function again to get the updated JSX snapshot reflecting the new state or props.
D. Re-rendering occurs only  when the parent component's state changes, requiring all child components to update their UI irrespective of their own state or props.

correct: C

7. What does the CSS property `box-sizing:border-box;` do?

D. It sets the vertical alignment of an element.

correct: A



9. What does the `calc()` function do in CSS?

A. It lets you perform calculations to determine CSS property values.
B. It calculates the maximum value of a specific CSS propery.
C. It calculates the average of CSS propery values.
D. It calculates the sum of all CSS propery values.

correct: A


10. How do you define CSS variables?

--variable-name: value;


11. What does the `transform` property do in CSS?

C. It changes the color of an element.
D. It adds a border to an element.

correct: A


What was the last piece of software you worked on?
What did you specifically build?

The last piece of software I worked on was an e-commerce dashboard.
I specifically built the product management interface using React.
This included creating reusable components for product listings and details.
I implemented a responsive design using Tailwind CSS for consistent styling across devices.
I also developed a dynamic filtering system using JavaScript to sort and search products efficiently.
Additionally, I integrated charts and graphs to visualize sales data, enhancing the user experience for store managers.
